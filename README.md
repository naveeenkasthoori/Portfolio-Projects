# Stock Portfolio Risk Analysis
I'll add more projects that I have been working  for past 12 months, Most of the projects either I practiced or client projects. I upload it if my client doesn't have any objection about it.
Introduction about The Project
In a fast moving world, everybody busy with the work or business. A human cannot focus multiple things at one time. Even if we do, It wont be as efficient as focusing one particular task. Everybody wants to create wealth, But they cant find time to do the analysis to make the investment decisions. Thats where we are stepping in and helping our clients to give suggestions to make investment decision.

Wealth Creation
In the process of creating wealth, we should have a goal, And We need to ask few basic question.

Like, which domain we would like to invest in?
In this case, We chose the stock market. How much we are ready to invest in?
How much returns we are expecting from our portfolio?
What is the risk percentage of our stocks?

So, In this project, We are choosing stocks from S&P 500 index. We chose 5 Industry sectors like,

1.Travel/Aviation/Hospitality
2.Banking/Financial Services and Insurance
3.Pharmaceuticals/Healthcare/Life Sciences
4.Technology/IT

And, We chose 6 stocks from each industry. Using these we need to create stock portfolio according to client needs.
